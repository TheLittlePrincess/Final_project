Data Visualization Bootcamp Final Project

## MACHINE LEARNING MODEL:
Team members present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:

What model should we use?
Since our hypothesis is that wealthier people generate more trash, we will use the linear regression model to understand the relationship between income and trash generation.

Is our data linear? 
We believe our data is linear.

Interested in outliers
